# One Health Tool (OHT) CKAN Instance

This is the master repo for the CKAN instance used to store data from Avenir Health's 
[One Health Tool (OHT)](https://www.avenirhealth.org/software-onehealth.php).

As OHT moves from the desktop to the cloud, Avenir Health has commissioned Fjelltopp to 
implement a CKAN instance to store and manage data in the back end. It is envisaged that 
this CKAN instance will be predominantly used via the API with some UI interaction from
sysadmins. The aim is to ensure that the data is stored in a flexible and secure manner,
making the most of CKANS rich feature set to deliver on OHT's requirements.

## Setup

Although we have open-sourced much of the code for this project, it is expected that
only approved developers will actually setup this code base. The project is typically run
within a Kubernetes based environment for which Fjelltopp can provide the configuration and 
documentation.
